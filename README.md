# RESTful API using ASP.NET Core and ION

This repository contains an example API written in C# and ASP.NET Core 1.1. It uses the [ION specification](http://ionwg.org/) as a starting point to model a consistent, clean REST API that embraces HATEOAS.

## History

This repository has been updated a number of times as I've refined my talks and examples (and learned more). You can see the early version of the code on the [v1 branch](https://github.com/nbarbettini/beautiful-rest-api-aspnetcore/tree/v1).
